Command to watch autoscale
    watch -n 1 kubectl get -n deployment deployment-ns
    here we cannot use shortcut of kubectl as k
    watch -n 1 kubectl get -n <ns-name> deployment-ns

    k get hpa
    k get hpa -n <ns-name>
    k describe hpa <hpa-name>
    k describe hpa <hpa-name> -n <ns-name>

Edit on fly, means we will edit file directly which is deployed into server or editing server file
server file has so many extra fields that we generally don't configure
    k edit hpa <hpa-name> -n <ns-na>
    k edit hpa app-tier -n deployment-ns
    here deployment is namespace

kubernetes depends on metrics collected
to use hpa, we first have to deployed metrics server to metrics available because autoscaling
using metrics of kubernetes
We also have to add cpu utilization in our pod then hpa will compute cpu autoscaling calculation

check rollout changes
    k rollout status deployment app-tier -n deployment-ns
    k rollout status deployment <deployment-name> -n <ns-n>

we can rollout pause by using pause command, it stop to generate new pod and complete it tasks
    k rollout pause deploy app-tier -n deployment-ns
    k rollout pause deployment <deployment-name>
    k rollout pause deployment <deployment-name> -n <ns-n>
undo changes
    k rollout undo pause deploy app-tier -n deployment-ns
    k rollout undo pause deployment <deployment-name>
    k rollout undo pause deployment <deployment-name> -n <ns-n>
See rollout history
    k rollout history deploy app-tier -n deployment-ns
    k rollout history deployment <deployment-name>
    k rollout history deployment <deployment-name> -n <ns-n>
